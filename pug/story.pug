            p In 2017, Dr. Ian Haworth and Dr. Maryann Wu served as Director of Curriculum and Director of Assessment at the University of Southern California (USC) School of Pharmacy.  With an imminent accreditation site visit, and the need to quickly gather curriculum and assessment data in a systematic way, Drs. Haworth and Wu set their sights out on creating a unique and novel technological solution that could go beyond the task of collecting hundreds of documents and spreadsheets and ultimately revolutionizing the way that academic and business operations were completed.
            p Drs. Haworth and Wu approached Dabrick Brill, a PhD student in Dr. Haworth’s lab, about the idea of creating a web-based syllabus portal that could standardize the way that faculty create their syllabi, allow them to generate their syllabi online, streamline the review and tracking of syllabi for administrators, improve curricular and programmatic assessment, address faculty workloads, assist with accreditation, enhance reporting senior leadership, and improve the overall efficiency of academic and business operations.
            p In 2017, !{name} (the Automated Approach to Reviewing and Developing Valuable Assessment Resources for your Curriculum) was born.  The School was fully re-accredited in 2017 and word began to quickly spread on the utility of the software product that was built.
